        <p>Whether it's watching blue, rolling waves crash against the sandy shore or hearing birds chirping in a green,
            luscious forest, there is something so remarkable and beautiful about being immersed in nature. It’s easy to
            be swept away with today’s technology and fast-paced living, but no matter where you are, nature always has
            a way of bringing peace to the mind and grounding a person.

            Although most of us spend our days online, it’s always important to unplug and step outside for a little
            sunshine and fresh air. Maybe it’s going for a walk in the park or planning a hike on a sunny weekend.
            Whatever you decide, we're sure it will be full of awe! And to celebrate Earth’s gifts, we are sharing some
            amazing nature quotes to emphasize some of the beauty and wonders of Mother Nature. </p>

        <p>"The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing which stands in the
            way. Some see nature all ridicule and deformity, and by these I shall not regulate my propositions. And some
            see no nature at all. But to the eyes of the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself." William
            Blake..."Some old-fashioned things like fresh air and sunshine are hard to beat." Laura Ingalls
            Wilder.."Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summer's day, listening to
            the murmur of the water, or watching the clouds float across the sky, is by no means a waste of time." Sir
            John Lubbock</p>
